# Fraud-Detection-UPI-ChatBot
## Abstract
''' The exponential growth of digital payment systems has ushered in a new era of convenience
and financial inclusivity. However, this transformation has also increased exposure to cyber
threats and fraudulent activities, especially in real-time transaction environments like the Unified
Payments Interface (UPI). To address this challenge, the UPI Fraud Detection Chatbot has been
developed as an intelligent, real-time fraud detection tool powered by machine learning and
designed to be accessible to both end-users and financial institutions.
The chatbot employs an ensemble of anomaly detection and classification models—including
Isolation Forest, One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost—to identify
potentially fraudulent transactions. These models analyze transaction attributes such as amount
and timestamp to detect outliers and suspicious patterns. By combining predictions using a
majority voting strategy, the system ensures robustness and reduces the risk of false positives
or negatives.
The architecture comprises a Python-Flask backend that hosts the machine learning models
and exposes prediction endpoints, along with a modern frontend built using HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, and Flatpickr for enhanced user experience. Users interact with a chatbot-style
interface to input transaction details and receive instant feedback on the risk level of the
transaction. The project also features an integrated reporting module, allowing for the
generation of downloadable PDF reports summarizing system functionality and outcomes.
Overall, the UPI Fraud Detection Chatbot bridges the gap between security and usability in
digital finance. It serves as a proof-of-concept for how data-driven methods and interactive user
interfaces can collaborate to prevent financial losses and enhance trust in electronic payment
systems. '''
## Introduction
### Purpose of the Project
''' The purpose of this project is to design and implement an intelligent, real-time fraud detection
system specifically targeted at UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions, which have seen
a dramatic rise in usage across India and other parts of the world. As digital transactions
become the default mode of financial interaction, ensuring their security becomes critically
important. Despite the convenience and speed offered by UPI platforms, they are often
susceptible to various forms of financial fraud, such as unauthorized access, phishing, account
takeovers, and anomaly-based scams. This project seeks to proactively address these threats
by building a user-centric application that utilizes machine learning to assess the legitimacy of a
transaction before it is completed.
Traditional fraud detection methods are typically rule-based and reactive—they identify
fraudulent activity only after it occurs or depend on a fixed set of patterns that may not
generalize well to new types of attacks. These limitations necessitate a more dynamic, adaptive
approach to fraud prevention. By using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, this
project aims to shift the paradigm from fraud detection to fraud prevention. The key innovation
lies in the use of ensemble machine learning models that are trained to detect anomalous
patterns in transaction data—particularly transaction amount and time—without requiring
predefined fraud rules.
Another purpose of this project is to democratize fraud detection by making the solution
accessible to individual users and small businesses through a web-based interface. Users can
enter basic transaction details and receive an instant evaluation on whether the transaction is
likely to be fraudulent. This interactivity not only empowers users to make safer decisions but
also increases awareness around fraud patterns and risk factors in digital payments.
From a technological standpoint, the project also serves as an educational and practical
platform for exploring end-to-end machine learning deployment. It involves data preprocessing,
model training, feature extraction, API integration, and frontend-backend communication.
Additionally, the project highlights how simplicity in design—via a chatbot-like UI—can
complement the sophistication of backend analytics to deliver an impactful tool.
In essence, the project's purpose is twofold:
1. to enhance the security and trustworthiness of UPI-based transactions through predictive
2. analytics.
to offer a scalable, modular framework that can be extended to other digital payment
ecosystems and fraud scenarios.
By combining practical utility with academic rigor, the project aligns with the growing demand for
AI-driven financial security solutions. '''
### What Problem It Solves
''' In the age of digital transformation, financial transactions have become faster, easier, and more
accessible than ever before. With platforms like UPI (Unified Payments Interface), users can
transfer money instantly with just a mobile device and minimal authentication. However, this
growing convenience has also opened the floodgates to a surge in fraudulent activities. Every
day, thousands of individuals fall victim to online scams ranging from phishing links and fake QR
codes to deceptive payment requests and identity theft. These attacks often go undetected until
it is too late, leading to irreversible monetary loss and long-term damage to user trust in digital
financial systems.
The core problem this project solves is the lack of proactive and accessible fraud detection
tools for everyday users. Most existing fraud detection systems are either integrated within
bank infrastructures or operate behind the scenes, away from the visibility of common users.
They are typically rule-based systems with static thresholds and predefined patterns, which
makes them vulnerable to newer and evolving fraud techniques that do not match historical
data. Moreover, these systems are often not available as open tools for consumers who want to
verify the safety of a transaction before proceeding.
This project addresses these gaps by introducing a user-interactive fraud detection system that
can assess the legitimacy of a UPI transaction in real time. By accepting just two
parameters—transaction amount and timestamp—the system evaluates the input using an
ensemble of machine learning models trained to recognize fraudulent patterns. This helps
detect outliers and unusual behavior that might indicate fraudulent intent. Importantly, the
solution is packaged in a simple chatbot interface, enabling even non-technical users to easily
input data and receive instant fraud assessments.
Another significant problem solved by this system is the delay in fraud detection. In
conventional workflows, fraud is often identified only after it has occurred and been reported by
the victim. By that time, the funds are typically unrecoverable. This project flips the script by
making detection possible before the transaction is confirmed, allowing users to reconsider or
cancel transactions flagged as risky. This preemptive approach greatly reduces the chances of
loss and introduces a layer of defense at the user level, where it is most urgently needed.
Furthermore, the solution is designed to be lightweight and easily extendable. This means it can
be adopted not only by individuals but also by fintech startups, educational platforms, or local
banking agents to increase awareness and security in regions where cybersecurity literacy is
still developing.
In summary, the project solves critical issues of accessibility, timeliness, and adaptability in
fraud detection by offering a predictive, real-time system that empowers users and addresses
the limitations of traditional rule-based or passive security models.

### System Architecture
#### High-Level Overview
''' The UPI Fraud Detection Chatbot is built on a modular and layered architecture that facilitates
seamless interaction between the user interface, backend services, and machine learning
components. The design ensures maintainability, scalability, and responsiveness, making it
suitable for real-time applications. The system follows a typical client-server architecture.
● Frontend (index.html, script.js):
○ User inputs transaction amount and timestamp.
○ Sends data via HTTP POST to Flask backend.
● Backend (app.py):
○ Receives input.
○ Loads pre-trained models (trained via generate_transactions.py).
○ Runs predictions using Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and XGBoost.
○ Uses majority voting to determine the final result.
○ Returns response to frontend.
1. User Interface (Frontend)
The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a clean, user-friendly
interface styled like a chatbot. It includes:
● A number input field for transaction amount.
● A datetime picker (powered by Flatpickr) for selecting the transaction timestamp.
● A "Send" button that submits the transaction data.

The JavaScript listens for form submission, validates input, and sends the data to the backend
using an asynchronous fetch() call via HTTP POST.

2. Flask API (Backend Layer)
The backend is implemented using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. It serves as the
intermediary between the frontend and the ML models. It exposes a RESTful API endpoint
(/predict) that:
● Accepts JSON input from the frontend.
● Parses the amount and timestamp.
● Preprocesses the input and prepares it for model inference.
● Routes the input to the ensemble ML model function.
● Returns the fraud prediction result (either "Fraud" or "Not Fraud").

3. Machine Learning Engine
The core intelligence of the system lies in its ML pipeline, which uses three distinct models
trained on labeled or synthetically generated transaction data:
● Isolation Forest: An unsupervised anomaly detection model that isolates anomalies
rather than profiling normal data.
● One-Class SVM: A support vector machine variant trained on normal data to identify
outliers.
● XGBoost Classifier: A supervised learning model trained on labeled data to classify
transactions based on complex decision boundaries.

Each model evaluates the transaction independently. Their predictions are then combined using
a majority voting mechanism:
● If two or more models detect fraud, the final result is marked as "Fraud"
● Otherwise, it is classified as "Not Fraud"

This ensemble approach improves robustness and reduces the chances of false positives or
false negatives.

4. Output Response
Once a prediction is made, the backend sends a JSON response back to the frontend, which
dynamically updates the UI with the result.

This structure ensures that each component performs a single responsibility, adhering to the
principles of modularity and separation of concerns.
## Database Diagram
Currently, the system operates on synthetic transaction data stored in a CSV file named
transactions.csv. This acts as a flat-file database for model training and experimentation
purposes. Here's an overview of the dataset schema:
Field Description
amount Transaction amount in INR (numeric).
timestamp Date and time of the transaction
(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM).
label Binary flag: 1 = Fraud, 0 = Not Fraud.
Sample data:
amount,timestamp,label
1299.0,2024-05-01 14:45,0
9999.0,2024-05-01 02:17,1
Data Flow
● The generate_transactions.py script generates and preprocesses this data.
● Data is used to train the ML models.
● Once trained, the models are serialized (pickled) and used by the Flask app for real-time
inference.

Future Database Integration
Although the current implementation uses a CSV-based dataset for simplicity and rapid
prototyping, the architecture is designed to be database-ready. Possible upgrades include:
● SQLite / PostgreSQL for storing transaction logs and user activity.
● MongoDB for handling large volumes of semi-structured transaction data.
● Firebase / Firestore for real-time syncing with mobile or cloud apps.

The database can later support:
● User authentication and role management.
● Historical transaction analysis.
● Graph-based fraud detection using linked transaction chains.

## Features Implemented
The UPI Fraud Detection Chatbot incorporates several key features that enable efficient,
real-time fraud detection for digital transactions. These features ensure that the system is both
user-friendly and robust in its ability to identify potentially fraudulent activities. Below is a
detailed breakdown of the implemented features:
1. User Input Form:
○ The system provides an intuitive user interface that allows individuals to enter
basic transaction data for fraud analysis. Users can input the transaction
amount and timestamp, which are the two key parameters needed to assess
the legitimacy of a UPI transaction. The form is built using HTML and styled with
CSS, providing a simple yet effective interface.
○ Users can select a timestamp using the Flatpickr datetime picker, which
simplifies the input process by providing an interactive calendar to choose the
date and time.
2. Real-Time Prediction:
○ After the user submits the transaction details, the data is sent to the backend,
where it is processed through an ensemble of machine learning models to detect
fraud. The system uses Isolation Forest, One-Class Support Vector Machine
(SVM), and XGBoost models to analyze the input data.
○ The models evaluate the transaction for any anomalies, outliers, or unusual
patterns in the transaction amount and timestamp. The system combines the
predictions of these models using a majority voting strategy. This ensures that
the final prediction is robust and minimizes the likelihood of false positives or
false negatives.
3. Chatbot UI:
○ To enhance the user experience, the frontend interface is designed as a chatbot.
This conversational format makes it easy for users to interact with the system.
After the user inputs the transaction details, the chatbot responds with an instant
prediction, either "Fraud" or "Not Fraud"
. This creates an engaging, user-friendly
experience, especially for individuals who may not be familiar with more technical
fraud detection systems.
4. Report Generator:
○ The system includes an integrated report generation feature, which allows
users to download a PDF report summarizing the transaction evaluation and
fraud detection results. This feature is powered by html2pdf.js, which converts
the HTML content into a downloadable PDF file. This functionality is useful for
users who want a formal record of their transaction evaluation for later reference.
5. Model Training Script:
○ A crucial part of the project is the model training pipeline. The
generate_transactions.py script generates synthetic transaction data and
trains the machine learning models. This script is responsible for the generation
of labeled data that is used to teach the models how to recognize fraudulent and
legitimate transactions.
○ The script uses a combination of real and synthetic data to create a balanced
dataset that helps the models learn to identify fraudulent activity.
6. Ensemble Prediction:
○ The heart of the fraud detection system is the ensemble learning approach. By
combining the predictions of three different machine learning models (Isolation
Forest, One-Class SVM, and XGBoost), the system improves its predictive
performance. The ensemble method leverages the strength of each individual
model to create a more accurate and reliable fraud detection tool.
○ The final decision is made based on a majority vote from the models, ensuring
that a transaction is flagged as fraudulent only if a sufficient number of models
agree on the outcome.
#### Future Enhancements and Additional Features
● User Authentication: Future versions of the system could incorporate a user
authentication mechanism to allow for tracking individual usage, enhancing security and
personalization.
● Transaction History Dashboard: A comprehensive dashboard could be added to
visualize and analyze a user's past transactions, flagged transactions, and potential
fraud patterns over time.
● Real-World Data Integration: The current system uses synthetic data for model
training. In the future, real transaction data could be incorporated to improve the models'
accuracy and relevance.
● Advanced ML Models: The inclusion of deep learning models or graph-based
algorithms could further enhance the fraud detection capabilities, particularly in
identifying complex fraud schemes or transaction rings.
● Centralized Database: For scalability, the system could be integrated with a database
like SQLite or MongoDB to store transaction logs, prediction results, and user activity for
auditing and compliance purposes.

Overall, the features implemented in the UPI Fraud Detection Chatbot provide a comprehensive
and effective solution for identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time, with a focus on user
accessibility and system robustness.
